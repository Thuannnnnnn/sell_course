    Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language with dynamic semantics. 
    Its high-level built-in data structures, combined with dynamic typing and dynamic binding, 
    make it very attractive for Rapid Application Development, as well as for use as a scripting 
    or glue language to connect existing components together.
    
    Python's simple, easy to learn syntax emphasizes readability and therefore reduces the cost 
    of program maintenance. Python supports modules and packages, which encourages program 
    modularity and code reuse.
